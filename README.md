# PYTHON SSH & REMOTE OPERATIONS PRACTICE – Using Paramiko

- This project contains Python programs created to practice basic SSH, SFTP, and remote system automation using the Paramiko library.
- It is designed for beginners and undergraduate students who want to understand how to interact with remote machines programmatically and perform secure operations via SSH.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- This project was created as part of my cybersecurity learning journey. The goal was to explore remote system interactions, command execution, file transfer, and automation using Python's Paramiko library.
- Through this project, I implemented scripts for:
  - SSH login and authentication
  - Running single and multiple commands on a remote system
  - Uploading and downloading files using SFTP
  - Executing Python scripts remotely
  - Restarting services on remote machines
  - Testing multiple passwords safely in a lab environment
 
## OBJECTIVES

- Learn how SSH works and how to automate it with Python  
- Understand secure remote connections  
- Practice executing commands remotely  
- Learn to transfer files securely using SFTP  
- Understand error handling and authentication exceptions  
- Learn to automate routine tasks on remote systems safely  
- Reinforce ethical programming practices


## TASKS IMPLEMENTED

- Connect to a remote machine via SSH and detect login success/failure
- Execute a single command (`ls`, `date`, `whoami`, `uname -a`) remotely  
- Execute multiple commands in one SSH session  
- Upload files to a remote system using SFTP  
- Download files from a remote system using SFTP  
- Execute a Python script on a remote machine  
- Restart a service (e.g., `nginx`) remotely  
- Attempt multiple passwords from a predefined safe list (lab environment only)  
- Handle command output and errors gracefully  
- Close SSH and SFTP connections properly after operations


## REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.x  
- paramiko module  

## Install required library using:
- pip install paramiko

## Works on:

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS


## HOW TO RUN

- Open VS Code or your preferred Python IDE
- Open the project folder
- Open any .py file
- Open terminal in VS Code
- Shortcut: `Ctrl + ``
### Run the program:
- python file_name.py


## FLOWCHART / ALGORITHM

- A flowchart was created to represent the overall workflow of the project, including SSH login, command execution, file transfer, and error handling.
- The flowchart image was generated for educational purposes to visualize the logic and workflow of all scripts in the project.
- **Note:** The flowchart was generated with AI assistance to help visualize the workflow. Using it allowed me to **deeply understand the logic and structure of SSH operations**, and AI guidance helped me **strengthen and deepen my knowledge** of remote system automation.

## LEARNING LEVEL

- Beginner to Intermediate
- Suitable for undergraduate students
- Good foundation for system automation and cybersecurity basics
- Helps understand secure remote operations and ethical automation
